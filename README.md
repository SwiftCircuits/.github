# SwiftCircuit

> Making precision control and instrumentation accessible to everyone.

SwiftCircuit is a non-profit open-source initiative focused on developing high-precision control systems and instrumentation that anyone can build, modify, and improve. We believe that advanced control systems shouldn't be locked behind expensive proprietary solutions.

## What We Do

We develop and maintain open-source hardware projects focusing on:

- Precision motor control systems
- High-accuracy measurement instruments
- Modular control platforms
- Educational resources and documentation

Our projects emphasize practical implementations, detailed documentation, and real-world reliability. We're not just sharing designs - we're building a community of makers and engineers who can learn from and build upon each other's work.

## Current Initiatives

### Learning Through Hardware
We're developing a series of educational boards specifically designed to demonstrate real-world electronic challenges and solutions. These boards help engineering students understand concepts like:

- Ground bounce and poor grounding effects
- Power supply noise and filtering
- Signal integrity in high-speed designs
- EMI/EMC practical considerations
- Thermal management challenges

Each board comes with comprehensive documentation and lab exercises, making them perfect for university-level electronics education.

### Open Source Modules
We're creating cost-effective, open-source modules for cutting-edge sensors and ICs that are typically hard to access or expensive to prototype with. Current focus includes:

- Time-of-Flight sensors (VL53L8CX, etc.)
- Precision ADCs and DACs
- Advanced IMU configurations
- Signal conditioning circuits

Our modules emphasize practical design, easy integration, and complete documentation.

## Featured Projects

### DCServo AE
Transform any brushed DC motor into a high-precision smart servo with absolute encoding. Perfect for robotics, CNC applications, and precision automation.

### OpenWave
A precision arbitrary waveform generator designed for system identification and control system analysis. Delivers exceptional signal quality up to 500 kHz with 80 dB SNR.

## Community Focus

While we maintain high engineering standards, we keep our communication and documentation approachable and practical. No corporate speak, no unnecessary complexity - just clear, detailed information that helps you understand and build upon our work.

## Get Involved

- **Use our designs**: All projects include complete source files and documentation
- **Contribute**: Help improve existing projects or propose new ones
- **Learn**: Detailed documentation and design insights for every project
- **Connect**: Join our community of makers and engineers

## Support Open Source
