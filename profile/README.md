## About SwiftCircuit

SwiftCircuit is a **non-profit, open-source initiative** dedicated to making high-precision control, sensing, power management, and embedded systems accessible to everyone. We develop robust, practical hardware modules and tools that anyone can build, modify, and improve.

We believe advanced hardware shouldn't be locked behind expensive proprietary solutions. Our goal is to empower makers, engineers, students, and researchers by providing high-quality, well-documented, open designs.

## What We Offer

We focus on developing and maintaining open-source hardware and software projects, including:

* **üîå Open Hardware Modules:** Cost-effective, easy-to-use breakout boards and modules for cutting-edge sensors (ToF, IMU, etc.), data converters (ADCs/DACs), power management ICs, and interface components.
* **üõ†Ô∏è Precision Tools & Systems:** Complete open-source solutions like high-performance motor controllers (e.g., DCServo AE), arbitrary waveform generators (e.g., OpenWave), versatile power supplies, and application-specific embedded systems (e.g., rocket flight computers).
* **üéì Educational Resources:** Hardware demonstration boards and accompanying resources designed to teach practical, real-world electronics concepts often missed in traditional curricula (grounding, noise, signal integrity, etc.).

**Our designs emphasize:**

* ‚úÖ **Practicality & Robustness:** Focused on real-world reliability and usability.
* üìö **Clear Documentation:** Comprehensive guides, schematics, and design insights.
* üëê **Accessibility:** Using readily available components where possible.
* üîì **Openness:** Permissive licenses (CERN-OHL-S v2 for hardware, MIT for software).
